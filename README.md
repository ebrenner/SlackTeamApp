# SlackTeamApp
This is a demo app (using the slack api). It consists of a starting screen displaying a list of sample team members. Clicking on an individual member in the list drills into the profile for that particular user.

-Volley used for network requests, allowing me to get responses back in string form

-Internal stroage used to persist string responses

-Gson used for JSON parsing because it is a convenient way to convert JSON directly to pojos

-Picasso used to load images from url and for caching

Note that I imported Volley as a module. You will have to do the same if you want to run this project after downloading.
